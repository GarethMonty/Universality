# Datanaut Datastore Adapter Roadmap

This document is the durable implementation memory for Datanaut's datastore workbench. It captures the product plan, adapter architecture, feature backlog, safety model, and testing expectations so the roadmap does not live only in chat history.

## North Star

Datanaut should provide a capability-driven workbench for many datastore families without pretending every engine behaves like SQL. Each adapter should expose what the engine can safely support: connection validation, metadata exploration, query execution, normalized result rendering, permissions, diagnostics, operation planning, and guarded admin/destructive workflows.

The product should prefer real engine protocols and SDKs over ORMs. ORMs can become an optional future context import feature, but they must not be a primary connection mechanism.

## Adapter Completion Bar

For this phase, "full implementation" means read/diagnostic-complete:

- Live connection validation where local/container access is realistic.
- Metadata explorer roots and child nodes that match the datastore family.
- Query execution or typed request-builder execution where live cloud execution is gated.
- Normalized result payloads: `table`, `json`, `document`, `keyvalue`, `raw`, `schema`, `diff`, `plan`, `metrics`, `series`, `searchHits`, `graph`, `profile`, and `costEstimate`.
- Permission inspection with effective roles/grants/IAM signals where available.
- Diagnostics for plans, profiles, metrics, query history, warnings, and cost/scan signals.
- Import/export and backup/restore operation planning.
- Guarded operation plans for writes, admin work, destructive DDL/DML, profiling that executes queries, and cloud-cost operations.

Destructive/admin mutation execution remains preview-only until a later pass explicitly enables execution with confirmation and permission checks.

## Families

The shared contract should support these datastore families:

- `sql`
- `document`
- `keyvalue`
- `graph`
- `timeseries`
- `widecolumn`
- `search`
- `warehouse`
- `embedded-olap`

## Query Languages

The shared contract should support these query languages:

- `sql`
- `t-sql`
- `plsql`
- `sqlite-sql`
- `mongodb`
- `redis`
- `cypher`
- `flux`
- `cql`
- `aql`
- `gremlin`
- `sparql`
- `promql`
- `influxql`
- `opentsdb`
- `query-dsl`
- `esql`
- `google-sql`
- `snowflake-sql`
- `clickhouse-sql`

## Capabilities

Adapters should advertise capabilities only when at least one operation, explorer surface, diagnostic payload, or renderer uses the capability.

Core capabilities:

- `supports_sql_editor`
- `supports_schema_browser`
- `supports_document_view`
- `supports_key_browser`
- `supports_graph_view`
- `supports_time_series_charting`
- `supports_visual_query_builder`
- `supports_result_snapshots`
- `supports_streaming_results`
- `supports_transactions`
- `supports_local_database_creation`
- `supports_ttl_management`
- `supports_structure_visualization`

Admin, security, and diagnostics:

- `supports_admin_operations`
- `supports_index_management`
- `supports_user_role_browser`
- `supports_permission_inspection`
- `supports_explain_plan`
- `supports_plan_visualization`
- `supports_query_profile`
- `supports_metrics_collection`
- `supports_query_cancellation`
- `supports_cloud_iam`
- `supports_cost_estimation`
- `supports_import_export`
- `supports_backup_restore`
- `supports_vector_search`

## Operation Model

Adapters should expose a typed operation layer rather than one-off UI buttons.

`DatastoreOperationManifest` should describe:

- Operation id.
- Engine.
- Family.
- Label.
- Object scope.
- Risk: `read`, `write`, `destructive`, `costly`, or `diagnostic`.
- Required capabilities.
- Supported result renderers.
- Whether confirmation is required.
- Whether execution is preview-only.

`OperationPlan` should include:

- Generated SQL, command text, API request, or SDK request plan.
- Whether the operation is destructive.
- Estimated cost or scan impact.
- Required permissions.
- Confirmation text.
- Guardrail warnings.

`PermissionInspection` should include:

- Effective roles/grants/IAM signals.
- Unavailable actions.
- User-facing disabled reasons.
- Warnings for read-only profiles, beta adapters, missing privileges, or unavailable cloud identity.

`AdapterDiagnostics` should include:

- Plans.
- Profiles.
- Metrics.
- Series.
- Query history.
- Cost estimates.
- Warnings.

## Guardrails

Datanaut should be conservative by default:

- Read-only profiles block writes before execution.
- Production/safe-mode profiles require explicit confirmation for DDL, DML, admin, backup/restore, import/export, and profiling that executes queries.
- `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, query profiling, deletes, drops, repairs, compactions, backup/restore, and cloud-cost operations must surface warnings.
- Permission-aware disabled actions should explain exactly why an action is unavailable.
- Secrets must be redacted.
- Large results should stream or page; adapters should avoid unbounded query generation.
- Native protocols, drivers, connection strings, local files, cloud SDKs, IAM, OAuth, SigV4, Entra, and Google ADC are valid connection modes.
- ORMs are not connection modes.

## Adapter Waves

### Wave 1: Foundation And Local SQL

Goals:

- Split the Rust adapter layer into registry plus family modules.
- Preserve the app-facing commands and trait shape.
- Deepen PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.
- Add TimescaleDB through PostgreSQL wire plus Timescale metadata.
- Add DuckDB local-file SQL execution and metadata.
- Add ClickHouse HTTP/native-over-HTTP read, query, metadata, and explain support.

### Wave 2: Document, Cache, Search, And Time-Series

Goals:

- MongoDB: databases, collections, indexes, find/aggregation, explain, stats.
- Redis and Valkey: key browser, SCAN, typed reads, TTL, INFO, SLOWLOG, ACL diagnostics.
- Memcached: stats, slabs/items/settings diagnostics, known-key reads, preview-only writes.
- Elasticsearch and OpenSearch: indexes, data streams, mappings, Query DSL, hits/aggs, explain/profile/stats.
- InfluxDB, Prometheus, OpenTSDB: metric/tag explorer, query execution, chartable series, status diagnostics.

### Wave 3: Graph And Wide-Column

Goals:

- Cassandra: CQL contract surface, keyspaces, tables, indexes, materialized views, tracing, partition-key guardrails; native binary protocol execution remains an isolated driver follow-up inside the Cassandra folder.
- Neo4j: Bolt/openCypher metadata, Cypher execution, graph/table results, EXPLAIN/PROFILE.
- ArangoDB: HTTP AQL execution, collections, graphs, indexes, explain/profile.
- JanusGraph: Gremlin request builder and contract adapter; live support after protocol path is confirmed.

### Wave 4: Cloud And Managed Contract Adapters

Goals:

- DynamoDB, Cosmos DB, Neptune, Snowflake, and BigQuery get typed request builders.
- Add dry-run/cost where available.
- Add IAM/permission inspection shapes.
- Add mocked contract tests.
- Gate optional live tests behind environment variables and credentials.

## Architecture Refactor Plan

The adapter layer should keep datastore-owned code together. The current preferred shape is:

```text
apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/adapters/
  mod.rs                 # facade and public exports only
  contract.rs            # DatastoreAdapter trait
  registry.rs            # authoritative runtime adapter registry
  runtime.rs             # command-facing dispatch helpers
  common/                # shared payloads, guardrails, paging, diagnostics, operations
  datastores/
    postgresql/          # PostgreSQL wire family: postgres, cockroach, timescale
    mysql/
    sqlite/
    sqlserver/
    duckdb/
    clickhouse/
    mongodb/
    redis/
    valkey/
    memcached/
    cassandra/
    neo4j/
    arango/
    janusgraph/
    neptune/
    dynamodb/
    cosmosdb/
    snowflake/
    bigquery/
    influxdb/
    prometheus/
    opentsdb/
    search/              # Elasticsearch/OpenSearch shared HTTP search family
    planned/             # only engines not yet concrete
```

Refactor rules:

- Keep `adapters::manifests`, `execution_capabilities`, `test_connection`, `list_explorer_nodes`, `inspect_explorer_node`, `execute`, `fetch_result_page`, `cancel`, `operation_manifests`, `plan_operation`, `inspect_permissions`, and `collect_diagnostics` stable.
- Move one datastore at a time unless several engines share a protocol implementation.
- Add contract tests before and after moving a family.
- Avoid changing behavior during extraction unless a bug is found.
- Prefer each datastore folder to contain narrow `catalog`, `connection`, `explorer`, `query`, and `diagnostics` modules over large family files.
- Keep preview/cloud adapters honest: beta maturity and preview-only risky operations until live execution exists.

## Test Plan

### Rust Contract Tests

Every adapter must cover:

- Manifest registration.
- Family.
- Query language.
- Capabilities.
- Operation manifests.
- Permission inspection.
- Diagnostics shape.
- Explorer root shape.
- Query execution payload shape, or request-builder payload for cloud previews.
- Pagination/cancellation response shape.
- Safe defaults.

### Fixture Tests

Local/container fixtures should cover:

- PostgreSQL
- CockroachDB
- SQL Server
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- SQLite
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Valkey
- Memcached
- Cassandra-compatible
- Neo4j
- ArangoDB
- InfluxDB
- Prometheus
- OpenSearch/Elasticsearch
- ClickHouse
- DuckDB

### Cloud Contract Tests

Mocked contract tests should cover:

- DynamoDB
- Cosmos DB
- Neptune
- Snowflake
- BigQuery
- Managed Elasticsearch/OpenSearch
- LiteDB bridge behavior

Optional live tests must run only when credentials and explicit environment variables are present.

### UI Tests

Every engine should have:

- Selectable connection profile.
- Per-engine screen.
- Explorer root.
- Query editor label.
- Diagnostics tab.
- Disabled reason rendering.
- Guarded operation preview.
- Visual builder preservation of filters/limits.

### Guardrail Tests

Guardrail tests must prove:

- Read-only profiles block writes.
- Production/safe mode requires confirmation for risky operations.
- Profiling and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` warn when they execute the query.
- Destructive DDL/DML is never silently executed.
- Cloud-cost operations show dry-run/cost warnings.

## Current Milestone State

At the time this document was written:

- CockroachDB is registered as a first-class MVP SQL engine.
- The adapter trait already exposes operation manifests, operation planning, permissions, diagnostics, result paging, cancellation, metadata explorer, and execution.
- PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, TimescaleDB, ClickHouse, Valkey, Memcached, ArangoDB, BigQuery, Cassandra, Cosmos DB, DuckDB, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, InfluxDB, JanusGraph, LiteDB, Neo4j, Neptune, OpenTSDB, Oracle, Prometheus, and Snowflake have concrete adapter structs.
- TimescaleDB, ClickHouse, Valkey, Memcached, Cassandra, LiteDB, Oracle, and cloud/managed adapters remain beta/read-diagnostic oriented where appropriate.
- Snowflake and BigQuery now use concrete cloud-contract request builders rather than the generic beta adapter.
- Cassandra now has a concrete CQL contract adapter with partition-key guardrails while native binary protocol execution remains a future driver pass.
- LiteDB now has a concrete .NET sidecar bridge contract adapter while live sidecar dispatch remains a future bridge pass.
- Oracle now has a concrete SQL/PLSQL contract adapter with Oracle client/runtime prerequisite warnings while native OCI/thin execution remains a future driver pass.
- The largest immediate architecture risk has shifted from `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/adapters/mod.rs` to the remaining large frontend workbench files and the need for continued drift tests between Rust manifests and the TypeScript roadmap.
