# Security And Safety

DataPad++ is expected to handle live credentials and production systems, so security and safety need to be part of the architecture rather than later polish.

## Secret handling

Preferred approach:

- store secret values in the OS credential store or keychain
- keep only references in regular app persistence
- redact secret values in logs, previews, and exports by default
- require explicit opt-in for any export that includes secrets
- keep connection tests and diagnostics from echoing raw passwords, tokens, private keys, or connection strings

## Environment safeguards

Environments are first-class and should carry visible risk context:

- Local / Dev: standard workflow
- QA / UAT / Stage: elevated awareness
- Prod: persistent warning state, stricter confirmation, optional safe mode

The active environment should remain visible in the shell, explorer, editor, and result views.

## Guardrails

Guardrails should be policy-driven and connection-aware:

- read-only connection mode
- confirmation for destructive operations
- banners for production or restricted environments
- warnings for large result sets or long-running operations
- unresolved variable detection before connect or execute
- preview-only plans for admin/destructive/schema/cloud-cost workflows
- explicit warnings for profiling operations that execute the query, such as `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
- disabled-action reasons when permissions, adapter maturity, read-only mode, or missing identity prevent an action

## Safe edits

DataPad++ supports safe live data edits only when an adapter can identify the target unambiguously and build a native or parameterized request.

Examples:

- SQL row edits require table and primary-key context.
- MongoDB document edits require a collection and document id.
- Redis/Valkey key edits require a concrete key.
- DynamoDB item edits require complete key conditions.
- Cassandra row edits require complete primary-key conditions.

When those conditions are missing, the UI should show a disabled action or a guarded plan instead of attempting a best-effort write.

## Operation previews

Guarded operation plans should show:

- generated SQL, command text, or API request body
- risk level
- destructive/costly flags
- required permissions
- estimated cost or scan impact where available
- environment/read-only guardrail status
- exact confirmation text when execution is supported

## Desktop protection

The native layer should support:

- app-level locking after inactivity
- optional master password or biometric unlock when feasible
- encrypted exports for portable artifacts
- clear separation between UI code and privileged native commands

## Compatibility fallbacks

`DATAPADPLUSPLUS_*` is the current environment variable prefix. Legacy `DATANAUT_*` and `UNIVERSALITY_*` variables may still be read by the native host for local workspace, fixture, and secret-store compatibility. New docs, scripts, and examples should use the DataPad++ prefix.

## Tracked dependency exceptions

- `monaco-editor` currently pulls a moderate `dompurify` advisory through the editor dependency chain. Do not run `npm audit fix --force` or downgrade Monaco to clear this artificially; keep the advisory tracked and upgrade Monaco when an upstream patch is available.
